# profiling-internet-users
The aim of this project is to demonstrate if the Internet usage of each subject is statistically indistinguishable when compared to the Internet usage of the same subject over time, while simultaneously being statistically distinguishable when compared to Internet usage of other subjects. Subsequently, we want to study how the time window chosen for profiling affects the answer to the above problem. You can implement a profile for each user based on many criteria; but, we suggest to use octets/duration. Duration can be obtained from "first" and "last" columns, and Octets can be obtained from "doctets" field in the Excel sheets.
